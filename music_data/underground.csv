Tech N9ne A wise man told me evil was lurkin and if you found it try your best to not put yourself around it Cuz when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but then when the sin beginnin you wish you would stay grounded I went all over the world and I done been through it at the beginning I knew I wouldn't give in to it but temptation over the sensation women I'm embracin so many of them waitin Contemplatin how to get fornication and yo door when its late with the motivation of Satan so they say but things go they way but its more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today But lust it sets in and crush your chest in for dust your destined if drugs are let in Enough to nest in probably make you punch your best friend and next kin cuz you let s e x win You mean to tell me you can fight this land with brightness and walk the path of the righteous man Yo I want to believe that itching to see that if a positive person can shake the negative feedback that this life has to offer and its faster What a disaster if you didn't obey the master Cuz that's mutiny it would be new to me if you was on tour with Tecca Nina and you could be Chorus Krizz Kaliko Strange Lane Choir Holy holy If you lived in another world would you Know me know me I know you be strong but you been gone a While I know you still my Child So I'm pullin for you Hold your only Your soul and if you know it wont you Show me show me You can see me if you look up for a While Holier than Thou So I say it for you Verse 2 Krizz Kaliko How can I move the crowd without losin out of my faith Lucifer out of the way way Or maybe he don't even exist I ain't gotta trip Gettin hookers out of my system get you out of my system See thats how he tricks em Let em sip then a big ol mickey he slips them I wonder why Music soothes the savage soul People could lose or win but lack control Wish we could choose to live and fast the soul We smashin women then bypass the soul They believin everything we breathe in Half of us is Jesus the other half is heathen And how we get that bad half out We pray the lord would cast that out Hope you got blessins let them pass that out When we travellin and pass that route Keep us under their grace is the place where we had that doubt Where I stand its pointin at me but its with my hand I need you you holier than I am I am Chorus Krizz Kaliko Strange Lane Choir Holy holy If you lived in another world would you Know me know me I know you be strong but you been gone a While I know you still my Child So I'm pullin for you Hold your only Your soul and if you know it wont you Show me show me You can see me if you look up for a While Holier than Thou So I say it for you Verse 3 Tech N9ne This verse was intended for a gospel rapper that we all admire and he goes by the name of a hrefwikiDaTRUTH titleDa TRUTH classmwredirectDa TRUTHa All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction and maybe if he came we could change and regroup So we laid it down and sent it hopin' we would rap wit us track splittas Waited and none of his people got back wit us We kept callin' and they finally answered when a month passed We was prepared to do whatever give it if he wants cash but the lady who represent em would never send 'em a message from a secular messenger Never be no nepotism we supposed to be brothers on the road to teach others but the flow would be covered don't wanna mess with Tech they know that we smothered anybody who diss us retire they weak flow Cuz this is the pinnacle nobody flyer than me bro If you didn't like it then I admire the ego And if they never told ya then you better fire ya people Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em but Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims but they always helpin in the hood but y'all closed me out y'all didn't even really wanna know what we bout And we bombay TRUTH aint on it so the don spay and I had to spit on in cuz I couldn't afford Kanye I needed help your people showed me the wall be lowly as y'all I guess y'all wasn't holy at all naw Much love to the gospel MC J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation Even though most if his peers told him not to cuz we secular MCs Thanks for giving me Da TRUTH CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro God bless you for being so Chorus Krizz Kaliko
